        <h2>Past academics and side skills</h2>
        <p>Throughout my formative years, I dedicated myself to diverse fields, amassing achievements that reflect my commitment to continuous growth and excellence. In the realm of music, I delved into the intricacies of piano, undergoing a rigorous course for approximately five years. My efforts bore fruit as I proudly secured two gold medals and several certifications, totaling around three, underscoring my proficiency in this melodic discipline.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Simultaneously, the discipline of Taekwondo became a cornerstone of my journey, with a dedicated training period spanning six to seven years. This martial arts endeavor resulted in the acquisition of four certificates, each marking the successful attainment of new levels within the discipline. The tenacity and discipline cultivated in Taekwondo have undoubtedly shaped my character and approach to challenges.</p>
        <br>
        <p>During my childhood, the world of dance became a canvas for self-expression, with a two-year exploration of movement and rhythm. Notably, my dance partner and I clinched a silver medal, symbolizing a harmonious synchronization and dedication to the art form.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In the academic sphere, I embarked on a six-year journey in advanced math courses, earning five certificates that represent proficiency at various levels. These certifications mirror my enduring curiosity and aptitude for analytical thinking.</p>
        <br>
        <p>These diverse experiences not only showcase my ability to commit to long-term pursuits but also reflect a multifaceted approach to personal development. Each achievement represents not only a skill mastered but also a testament to my resilience and passion across different domains.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In addition to my pursuits in music, martial arts, dance, and mathematics, I embarked on a captivating journey in the realm of ice skating, dedicating a year to mastering this elegant and dynamic sport. As I glided through the rink, I embraced the challenges and joys of ice skating, cultivating a newfound appreciation for balance, precision, and artistic expression on the ice. Though my time on skates may be relatively short compared to other endeavors, this experience has added a unique dimension to my eclectic skill set, further enriching my personal and physical development.</p>
